Project/ Homework Notes (further noted in HTML/ CSS code)
-I updated the "website" title to "Horiseon"
-Search Engine Optimization hyperlink is now working to display referenced section of page. Link works just like the other navbar items, online reputation management, and social media marketing links.  
-Commented out classes on style.css page if they are not targeted anywhere in index.html. Also commented out classes if they were consolidated into one uniform task, and updated class="" on index.html.
