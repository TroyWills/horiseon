Project/ Homework Notes (further noted in HTML/ CSS code)
-I updated the "website" title to "Horiseon"
-The Search Engine Optimization link was working once I added the DIV ID, but the marketing-meeting picture was then removed. My VSS links to MS EDGE despite my default browser being Chrome. In MS Edge it appeared to work, but then when I viewed in Chrome in my deployed link above, this was not the case. 
-I was unable to consolidate the classes either without running into issues. It has something to do with the container settings. 
-I'm now having issues with staging changes in VSS, receiving error "fatal error occured", GIT COMMMIT -M "final upload" not working
